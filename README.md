# Data Collection Pipeline
Developed a module that scraped data from various sources using Selenium (and maybe Requests) 
Performed unit testing and integration testing on the application to ensure that the package published to Pypi is working as expected.
Used Docker to containerise the application to make it easily deployable.
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to push a new Docker image
